# Intel_Industrial_AI

### A project where a team (us) from Imperial College London, a mixture of penultimate year Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering students, worked with a team from Intel based in the UK and US to explore the possibility of replacing traditional PID-controllers for motor control with Machine Learning implementations which could run on Intel's budget range of FPGAs (Field-Programmable-Gate-Array).
### The solution veered towards using Reinforcement Learning to solve this problem. The final Neural Network would then be able to be exported to HDL and synthesized for an FPGA.

### Here is a video detailing our work and progress.
