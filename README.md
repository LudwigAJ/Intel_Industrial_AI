# Intel_Industrial_AI


## Introduction
#### A project where a team (us) from Imperial College London, a mixture of penultimate year Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering students, worked with a team from Intel based in the UK and US to explore the possibility of replacing traditional PID-controllers for motor control with Machine Learning implementations which could run on Intel's budget range of FPGAs (Field-Programmable-Gate-Array).
#### The solution veered towards using Reinforcement Learning to solve this problem. The final Neural Network would then be able to be exported to HDL and synthesized for an FPGA.

## Contents of Repository
### Folders
#### In this repo you will find 3 folders. In the two named 'HDL Files and Report/...' and 'Models from report/...' you will find the data/figures, Simulink models, and MatLab scripts which are mentioned in the report. There is also an addition folder called 'extraModels', this folder contains some extra trained and untrained variations of the algorithms which were tested in our work.
### Documentation and Leaflet
#### You will also be able to find PDFs of the Leaflet made for the project, as well as the OneNote used for taking notes. The repo of course also includes the final documentation for our project.

### Here is a video demonstrating our work and progress.

### This GitHub is linked to from the documentation written for this project and serves as the storage for our models and code.

### It also contains a leaflet designed by us as well as the documentation detailing our work and progress.
##### Please note that any promises/data presented about any products or services is purely done by the us and not Intel. It is all fictional and purely there as examples for us. i.e. don't sue us nor Intel for stuff seen here.
