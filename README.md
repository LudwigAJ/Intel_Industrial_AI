# Intel_Industrial_AI

### A project where a team (us) from Imperial College London, a mixture of penultimate year Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering students, worked with a team from Intel based in the UK and US to explore the possibility of replacing traditional PID-controllers for motor control with Machine Learning implementations which could run on Intel's budget range of FPGAs (Field-Programmable-Gate-Array).
### The solution veered towards using Reinforcement Learning to solve this problem. The final Neural Network would then be able to be exported to HDL and synthesized for an FPGA.


### Here is a video demonstrating our work and progress.

### This GitHub is linked to from the documentation written for this project and serves as the storage for our models and code.

### It also contains a leaflet designed by us as well as the documentation detailing our work and progress.
